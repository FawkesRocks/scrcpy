# scrcpy (v2.0)

_pronounced "**scr**een **c**o**py**"_

This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via
USB or [over TCP/IP](doc/device.md#tcpip-wireless), and allows to control the
device with the keyboard and the mouse of the computer. It does not require any
_root_ access. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.

Its features include:
 - [audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) (Android >= 11)
 - [recording](doc/recording.md)
 - mirroring with [Android device screen off](doc/device.md#turn-screen-off)
 - [copy-paste](doc/control.md#copy-paste) in both directions
 - [configurable quality](doc/video.md)
 - Android device [as a webcam (V4L2)](doc/v4l2.md) (Linux-only)
 - [physical keyboard/mouse simulation (HID)](doc/hid-otg.md)
 - [OTG mode](doc/hid-otg.md#otg)
 - and moreâ€¦

## Prerequisites

The Android device should be on Andriod 5.0 or later.

Andriod 11 or later is required for audio forwaarding.

Make sure you enabled USB debugging on your Andriod device. This can be done by going to Settings> About Phone, Scroll down to "build number", and tap it 7 times. If done correctly, the message "You are now a develpoer!" will appear.

On some devices, you also need to enable an additional option, `USB
debugging (Security Settings)` (this is an item different from `USB debugging`)
to control your device using a keyboard and mouse.
